TPSCI ground state calculation for Hexabenzocoronene in sto3g basis using schmidt cluster basis.


Main purpose:
To analyze the effect of nbody i.e interaction between clusters and delta electrons i.e number of electron excitations w.r.t to reference fock space in computing the ground state energy.


status of calculations:
nbody 0 and 1 calculations are done.
nbody 2,3,4 calculations are going on, hope to finish by tommorrow, tuesday.
