TPSCI ground state calculation for Hexabenzocoronene in sto3g basis using schmidt cluster basis.


Main purpose:
To analyze the effect of nbody i.e interaction between clusters and delta electrons i.e number of electron excitations w.r.t to reference fock space in computing the ground state energy.
