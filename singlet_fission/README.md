 1,2*    diab = [1,2,3,6,7,10,11,14,20,26]
 2,3     diab = [1,3,4,7,8,11,12,17,23,29]
 1,4*    diab = [1,2,5,6,9,10,13,16,22,28]
 1,3     diab = [1,2,4,6,8,10,12,15,21,27]
 2,4*    diab = [1,5,3,9,7,13,11,18,30,24]
 3,4*    diab = [1,4,5,8,9,12,13,19,25,31] 

 *means i actually ran those dimers 

 Mapping info also in individual readmes
